        I was born in Wellington, New Zealand at the turn of the millennium. At the age of 11, I was given my first digital camera – and I suppose you could say that was where it all began. Yes, it sure as heck wasn’t the most advanced piece of equipment, but I owe my passion and interest in photography to it. From an early age, I also had an interest in trains. My grandfather is a keen train enthusiast, and after spending a lot of time with him in my early years – I got the bug as well.

            In 2016, I saved all my money to buy a decent DSLR, and there my skill-level and passion grew. I have combined both my interests in trains and photography to be rewarded with images published on Maori TV, NZ Railfan magazine, and the NZR&LS Observer magazine. In addition to this, a couple of photos that I have taken have been included in the Dominion Post newspaper, and on the NZ Herald’s website. I have photographed a select few events, including a wedding, a singing competition and a couple of 21sts. I really enjoy what I do, and have found great benefit in recent years making it more of a casual job – not only helping grow my portfolio, but also sharing my passion with other people. Images that convey emotion, feeling, and make the audience think are my favourite to take – weather thoroughly planned out, or taken on the fly – they all have their place.
